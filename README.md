Jackson Philion, Sep.18.2024, jphilion@g.hmc.edu This repository contains the code for Lab 2 of E155 at Harvey Mudd College, taught by Prof Josh Brake. The FPGA folder contains the necessary code to run the FPGA and dual 7 segment display. The draftMCU code contains the code that I thought I would need to mirror the fourth and fifth LED signals using the MCU, but I turned out not to need it. The simulation folder contains the modelsim version of the code with an automatic LED testbench and a quasi-automatic displayMultiplexer testbench. See my writeup of Lab 2 for more information on how to run it. The Notes and Extras folder contains calculations, relevant screenshots, and more.

You can view a full write up of this lab and all my others on my portfolio website: https://jacksonphilion.github.io/hmc-e155-portfolio/

I also want to credit the following website for helping me understand PNP transistor switches: https://eepower.com/technical-articles/how-to-operate-a-transistor-as-a-switch/#
